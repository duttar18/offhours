                OffHours is a next generational education platform that provides
                on demand office hours and discussions streamed straight to your
                personal device. Students can browse and join classes and chat
                with the instructors in each room to learn and ask questions.
                Itâ€™s fun, casual and reliable and takes all the benefits of a
                traditional classroom and streams it straight to your preferred
                studying location without you having to move an inch. OffHours
                allows teachers of all kinds to express themselves in teaching,
                whether through working their own hours or to the environment
                they wish to cultivate. Anything from a detailed lecture to a
                casual hangout to answer questions is all possible with our
                platform.{" "}
